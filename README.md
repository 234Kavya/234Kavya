# Hi, I'm Kavya 👋  
**Product-focused engineer building simple, reliable, and meaningful experiences.**

I care about clarity, user empathy, and solving the right problems—not shipping features for the sake of it.  
My work blends product sense, data-thinking, and engineering to turn ideas into systems people actually enjoy using.

---

## 🚀 What I Enjoy Working On
- Understanding user behavior, drop-offs, and motivations  
- Turning ambiguous problems into structured product requirements  
- Designing simple flows that remove friction  
- Using data (SQL, Mixpanel, dashboards) to guide decisions  
- Building 0→1 and iterating based on real feedback
